**What is CIA traids?**

The CIA traids is foundational model in cybersecurity, standing for Confidentiality, Intergrity and Availability. It outlines the three essential principle that ensure the protection of data.

**Confidentiality**:- Refers to protecting sensitive infromation from unauthorised access or disclousre.

**Integrity**:- Refers to maintain acuuracy and consistency of the data. that is not tempered with or modified in unauthorised manner.

**Availability**:- Refers to ensuring that system data and resources are avialable and accessible to authorised user when needed.

**Explain Vulnerability, Threats, Exploit and Riks?**

**Vulnerability**:- A Vulnerability is a flaw, loopholes, oversight and error that can be exploited by violate system security policy.

**Threats**:- A threat is an event, natural or man-made able to cause the negative impact of an organisation.

**Exploit**:-An Exploit is defined as way to  breach the security of an IT System through a Vulnerability.

**Risk**:- It is situation involving exposure to danger.

**What is AAA?**

It is stand for Authenticaton, Authorization and Accounting. It is framework for controlling access to resources and proper identify verification and tracking the use of system resources.

**Authentication**:- Authentication is the process of verifying the identify a user, device or system attempting a access a network or resources.

**Authorization**:- Authorization is the process of granting access to resources or infromation based on user's identify role or  privileges.

**SYN(SYNCHRONIZE)**:- The client send a SYN message to the server to initiates connection.

**SYN-ACK**:- The server sends (SYN-ACK) packets to the client . if it has open ports.

**ACK(Acknowledgement)**:- The client sends an (ACk) packet to confirm the connection is establish.

**What IS SSL/TLS handshake?**
--SSL Stand for  Secure Scoket layer.

--Netscape was developed the first version of SSL in 1995.

--SSL is a cryptographic protocol that uses explicit connections to establish secure communication between webserver and client.

--Three version of SSL have been released SSL 1.0,2.0 and 3.0 .

**TLS**

--TLS Stand for Transport Layer Security.

-- the first version of TLS was developed by the internet engineering taskforce (IETF) in 1999.

-- TLS is alo a cryptographic protocol that provides secure communicatiob between weserver and client via implicit connections.

-- Four version of TLS have been released TLS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3.
