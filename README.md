**What is Cyber security?**

cybersecurity protects computer sytem network and data from theft damage and unauthorised access. It Important to safeguard sensitive ifnformation , maintain privacy and prevent financial losses and protect critical infrastructure from cyber threats.

**What is Information security?**

Information security is the process of employed to safeguard inforamtion in any form (Physical or electronic) from unauthorised accessed, discloure and destruction.

---
**What is CIA traids?**

The CIA traids is foundational model in cybersecurity, standing for Confidentiality, Intergrity and Availability. It outlines the three essential principle that ensure the protection of data.

**Confidentiality**:- Refers to protecting sensitive infromation from unauthorised access or disclousre.

**Integrity**:- Refers to maintain acuuracy and consistency of the data. that is not tempered with or modified in unauthorised manner.

**Availability**:- Refers to ensuring that system data and resources are avialable and accessible to authorised user when needed.

---

**Explain Vulnerability, Threats, Exploit and Riks?**

**Vulnerability**:- A Vulnerability is a flaw, loopholes, oversight and error that can be exploited by violate system security policy.

**Threats**:- A threat is an event, natural or man-made able to cause the negative impact of an organisation.

**Exploit**:-An Exploit is defined as way to  breach the security of an IT System through a Vulnerability.

**Risk**:- It is situation involving exposure to danger.

---
**What is AAA?**

It is stand for Authenticaton, Authorization and Accounting. It is framework for controlling access to resources and proper identify verification and tracking the use of system resources.

**Authentication**:- Authentication is the process of verifying the identify a user, device or system attempting a access a network or resources.

**Authorization**:- Authorization is the process of granting access to resources or infromation based on user's identify role or  privileges.

**Accounting**:- Accounting is refers to tracking and record the action performed by a user or system. It helps monitor activities,create logs and maintain audit trails for future analysis and complinace purposes.

---

**Define Identification**

Identification is the process of reognizing and uniquely identifying user within system or application. It establishe who the user.

---

**What is 3-way Hanshake?**

A three way handshake is a method of TCP/IP network to create a connection  between a local host/ client and server.

**SYN(SYNCHRONIZE)**:- The client send a SYN message to the server to initiates connection.

**SYN-ACK**:- The server sends (SYN-ACK) packets to the client . if it has open ports.

**ACK(Acknowledgement)**:- The client sends an (ACk) packet to confirm the connection is establish.

----

**What IS SSL/TLS handshake?**
--SSL Stand for  Secure Scoket layer.

--Netscape was developed the first version of SSL in 1995.

--SSL is a cryptographic protocol that uses explicit connections to establish secure communication between webserver and client.

--Three version of SSL have been released SSL 1.0,2.0 and 3.0 .

**TLS**

--TLS Stand for Transport Layer Security.

-- the first version of TLS was developed by the internet engineering taskforce (IETF) in 1999.

-- TLS is alo a cryptographic protocol that provides secure communicatiob between weserver and client via implicit connections.

-- Four version of TLS have been released TLS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3.


---

**Accounting and Auditing**

-- Accounting is refers to tracking and recording to the action performed by a user or system. It helps monitor activities, create logs, and maintain audits trails for future analysis and compliance purposes.

**Auditing**

--The portion of accouting requires secuirty professionals to examine logs of what was recorded.

---

**Encryption , Encoding  and Hashing**

--**Encryption**:-Protect data confidentiality by transforming plaintext into cipher text.

--EX:- AES, RSA

--**Encoding**:- Transform data into a different format for proper.

--EX:- Base64, ASCII ,URL ,encoding

--**Hashing**:-  Ensure data integrity by transforming data into a fixed-size string.

--Ex:- MD5, SHA-1 , SHA-256

---

**Differnce between TCP and UDP**
**TCP** 
--It stands for Transmission Control Protocol.

-- It is a connection oriented protocol.

--Acknowledgement is received.

--TCP is compratively slower than UDP.

-- TCP is used by HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP and telent.

**UDP**

--It stands for user-datagram protocol.

--It is connection less protocol.

--Acknowledgment is not received.

--UDP is faster simpler and more efficient than TCP.

--UDP is used by DNS , DHCP, TFTP,SNMP, RIP,VOIP.

---

**What is OSI Model?**

--OSI stand for open system interconnections a reference model that descibes how information from a software appliactions in one computer moves through a physical medium to the software application in another computer.

-- OSI model consist of seven layers and each layer performs particular network function.

--Upper layer of the OSI model mainly deals with the application related issues and they are implemented only in the software.

--Lower layer of the OSI model deals with the data transport issues. the data link layer and the  physical layer are implemented in hardware and software.

----

**Application Layer**

--Application layer interface directly interacts with the application and provides common web application services.

**Protocol**:- HTTP, FTP, SMTP, POP, SNMP, DHCP.

**Attack**:- EXploit.

---

**Persentation Layer**
--Translate, encrypt, and compress data.

**Protocol**:-SSL, TLS, ASCII, JPEG, MPEG.

**Attack**:- Phishing.

---

**Session Layer**
--To establish, manage, and terminate sessions.

**Protocol**:- NetBios, PPTP, RPC, SIP, SSH.

**Attack**:- Hijacking.

---

**Transport Layer**
--Provide reliable end to end communication solution.

--From Segments

**Protocol**:- TCP, UDP, SCTP, DCCP, SPX.

**Attack**:- Reconnaissance.

---

**Netwrok Layer**

--Move packets from source to destination.

--Internetworking, Addressing

--From Packets.

**Protocol**:- IP, ICMP, ARP,OSPF, BGP, RIP.

**Attack**:- MITM(Man in the middle Attack).

---

**Data Link Layer**

--Framing error detection and correction acknowledgment, flow controls, ensuring well-defined relaiable service interface to the  network layer encapsulating packets from netwok layer to frames,etc.

--From Frames.

**Protocol**:- Bridge, Switch, Ethernet, PPP, HDLL.

**Attack**:- Spoofing.

---
**Physical layer**
-- Controls the way unstrucutred, raw,bit-stream data is sent and received over a physical medium.

-- Composed of the electrical, optical and physical components of the netwrok.

--From Bits

**Protocol**:- COax, Fiber, wireless, RJ45, Bluetooth.
**Attack**:- Sniffing.
